#osrs_exchange v0.0.2
osrs_exchange is a python wrapper for [Oldschool Runescape Wiki Grand Exchange Data API](https://prices.runescape.wiki/osrs/). Learn more about the project [here](https://oldschool.runescape.wiki/w/RuneScape:Real-time_Prices)

##Usage
I still need to work on proper interface imports and more testing needs to be done so use at your own risk.
`import ge.wikige` will import the correct package.
Afterwards, initialize the ge with `ge.wikige.WikiGe()`.
Further documentation will be provided soon.

## Testing Files
The files you'd want to use to use pytest can be found [here](https://www.mediafire.com/folder/jgydulp1rmcl3/files_for_testing).

Then run: `mkdir tests/files_for_testing` and copy the files into this directory.
